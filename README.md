## I'm a Backend Engineer

Backend engineer who believes that **production should be boring**.  
If it’s not, someone probably forgot a test.

I build backend systems that stay calm under load,  
handle edge cases gracefully,  
and don’t surprise anyone at 3 a.m.

### Engineering philosophy

- Production is not a place to learn
- Boring systems are well-designed systems
- Tests are cheaper than on-call anxiety
- If it can fail, it eventually will

---

### What I work with

- **Languages:** Kotlin, Java, C
- **Frameworks:** Spring Boot, JPA, QueryDSL  
- **Databases:** MySQL
- **Infra:** AWS
- **Testing:** TDD, Kotest(I even contribute)

### Things I’ve built (and kept boring)

- Payment & subscription systems that survive retries
- Idempotent APIs
- Scheduled billing jobs that don’t panic at midnight
- Concurrency-safe services

### Open Source

- **MockK contributor**  
  Implemented a feature to restrict unsafe mocking behavior

### What my code usually causes

- Fewer production incidents
- Calmer on-call rotations
- Slightly happier PMs
